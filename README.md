# Overview and Background

One of the key responsibilities of the Clerk of the Papers office is to receive a list of Departments and entities required to table their annual reports by the end of September. The Clerk of the Papers is then expected to produce a report which highlights which Departments and entities submitted their reports within or outside of the deadline.

Currently, the Clerk of the Papers is using a Microsoft Word template to manually capture all the papers received, the name of the department, and the date on which it was tabled. The capture, tracking, and reporting on papers tabled by various departments is all done manually. This can be a time-consuming process, and the office needs some form of automation to gain efficiencies.

The Clerk of the Papers has engaged with ICT to seek and identify a solution that would assist the office to work efficiently and effectively. The ICT department has crafted this document to unpack the high-level requirements necessary to meet the needs of the Clerk of Papers.
